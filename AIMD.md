# Ab initio molecular dynamics

## 1. Introduction
Molecular dynamics (MD) simulates the evolution of a many-body system in time, providing insights into structure, dynamics, and thermodynamic properties. Most classical MD simulations rely on empirical or semi-empirical force fields (FFs) to describe interatomic forces, limiting their applicability to systems or conditions for which parameter sets are known and accurate.

In contrast, **ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD)** relies on quantum mechanical (QM) methods, typically Density Functional Theory (DFT) or Hartree-Fock (HF), to evaluate forces “on the fly.” AIMD does not require pre-parameterized force fields but is significantly more computationally demanding. Within AIMD, there are two widely employed paradigms:

- **Born–Oppenheimer (BO) Molecular Dynamics**: Electrons are assumed to be at the electronic ground state for each instantaneous nuclear configuration.
- **Car–Parrinello Molecular Dynamics (CPMD)**: Electrons and nuclei (ions) are evolved simultaneously according to a unified (fictitious) dynamics.

At the heart of AIMD lies the **Born–Oppenheimer approximation**, which justifies the separation of electronic and nuclear motion based on their mass difference. Below, we detail its formal derivation and how it connects to the CPMD approach.

## 2. Born–Oppenheimer Approximation

### 2.1 Full Schrödinger Equation
Consider a molecular or condensed-phase system with $N_n$ nuclei and $N_e$ electrons. Let $\mathbf{R} = \{R_1, R_2, \dots, R_{N_n}\}$ denote the nuclear coordinates and $\mathbf{r} = \{r_1, r_2, \dots, r_{N_e}\}$ the electronic coordinates. The total (non-relativistic) Hamiltonian is:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1359282d-20d1-4797-bfae-b6499b5aab85)


Here:
- $T_{\text{nuc}}$ is the nuclear kinetic energy operator with masses $M_I$.
- $T_{\text{elec}}$ is the electronic kinetic energy operator with the electron mass $m_e$.
- $V$ includes electron-electron repulsion, electron-nuclear attraction, and nuclear-nuclear repulsion.

The time-independent Schrödinger equation for the total wavefunction $\Psi(\mathbf{r}, \mathbf{R})$ is:

$$
\hat{H} \Psi(\mathbf{r}, \mathbf{R}) = E \Psi(\mathbf{r}, \mathbf{R}).
$$

Solving this many-body equation exactly is intractable for large systems, motivating approximate methods.

### 2.2 Separation of Nuclear and Electronic Motion

#### 2.2.1 Rationale
Nuclei are much heavier than electrons ($M_I \gg m_e$), so nuclei move more slowly. Electrons rapidly adjust to changes in nuclear positions, suggesting we can approximate the total wavefunction as:

$$
\Psi(\mathbf{r}, \mathbf{R}) \approx \Phi_\mathbf{R}(\mathbf{r}) \, \chi(\mathbf{R}),
$$

where:
- $\Phi_\mathbf{R}(\mathbf{r})$ is the electronic wavefunction, depending parametrically on fixed nuclear coordinates $\mathbf{R}$.
- $\chi(\mathbf{R})$ is the nuclear wavefunction.

---

#### 2.2.2 Electronic Schrödinger Equation
Fix $\mathbf{R}$ and solve for the electrons:

where:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ed627974-6b07-4e9a-8f50-fe100773a2df)


$E_{\text{elec}}(\mathbf{R})$ is the electronic energy (the eigenvalue of $\hat{H}_{\text{elec}}$). This yields a **potential energy surface (PES)** for the nuclei:

$$
U(\mathbf{R}) = E_{\text{elec}}(\mathbf{R}) + E_{\text{nn}}(\mathbf{R}).
$$

---

#### 2.2.3 Nuclear Schrödinger Equation
Given $U(\mathbf{R})$, solve the effective Schrödinger equation for the nuclei:

$$
\left[
\sum_{I=1}^{N_n} -\frac{\hbar^2}{2M_I} \nabla_{R_I}^2 + U(\mathbf{R})
\right] \chi(\mathbf{R}) = E_{\text{total}} \chi(\mathbf{R}).
$$

The **Born–Oppenheimer approximation** neglects the coupling between electronic and nuclear wavefunctions that arises from the nuclear kinetic operator acting on $\Phi_\mathbf{R}(\mathbf{r})$. This yields an accurate description of molecular ground-state energies and nuclear dynamics for many standard chemical processes.

## 3. Born–Oppenheimer Molecular Dynamics (BOMD)
In BOMD, we treat the nuclei classically but compute forces from a quantum mechanical electronic structure calculation at each timestep. This approach effectively solves:

### 3.1 Electronic Structure Step
For each instantaneous set of nuclear coordinates $\mathbf{R}(t)$, minimize the electronic energy $E_{\text{elec}}(\mathbf{R}(t))$ (e.g., using DFT or HF).

---

### 3.2 Nuclear Propagation
Integrate Newton’s equations of motion for the nuclei on the PES $U(\mathbf{R})$:

$$
M_I \frac{d^2 R_I}{dt^2} = -\nabla_{R_I} U(\mathbf{R}).
$$

Here, $-\nabla_{R_I} U(\mathbf{R})$ is computed by electronic structure derivatives (Hellmann–Feynman and Pulay terms in DFT).

**BOMD Key Points:**
- At each step, the electronic wavefunction is fully converged to the ground state consistent with the current nuclear geometry.
- Computationally expensive due to SCF (self-consistent field) or diagonalization procedures at each step.

---

## 4. Car–Parrinello Molecular Dynamics (CPMD)

CPMD introduces a fictitious electron mass to propagate electronic wavefunctions dynamically, avoiding a full SCF minimization at each timestep. This is achieved through a unified Lagrangian formulation.

---

### 4.1 Car–Parrinello Lagrangian
Assume a representation of the electronic wavefunction via single-particle orbitals $\{\psi_j\}$ (e.g., Kohn–Sham DFT):

$$
\Psi(\mathbf{r}, t) \approx \{\psi_j(\mathbf{r}, t)\}, \, j = 1, \dots, N_e/2.
$$

The CPMD Lagrangian is:

where:
- $\mu$ is the fictitious electron mass.
- $\Lambda_{jk}$ enforces orbital orthonormality.
- $E_{\text{DFT}}$ is the DFT total energy functional.

### 4.2 Equations of Motion

# The Electron Wavefunctions and CPMD Dynamics

The electron wavefunctions are propagated under a fictitious kinetic energy term:

$$
\frac{1}{2} \mu \dot{\psi}^2.
$$

If $\mu$ is sufficiently small and the initial orbitals are well converged, the orbitals remain close to the instantaneous Born–Oppenheimer surface (i.e., near the electronic ground state) without requiring a full SCF minimization at each step. 

This is the genius of **Car–Parrinello Molecular Dynamics (CPMD)**: it is more efficient than BOMD in many contexts because it avoids repeated large diagonalizations or iterative SCF procedures at each step.

---

## 4.3 Fictitious Electron Mass and Adiabaticity

- **Choice of $\mu$**: Must be chosen so that the electronic degrees of freedom remain at high enough “frequency” to adiabatically follow nuclear motion but do not pick up large kinetic energy from the nuclear motion.

- **Temperature Control**: Typically, the fictitious electron kinetic energy is thermostatted (using a Nosé–Hoover chain or similar) to keep electrons near the ground-state manifold.

If done correctly, CPMD approximates Born–Oppenheimer dynamics to a good degree. However, if $\mu$ is too large or the electron thermostat is improperly chosen, the system may deviate from the Born–Oppenheimer surface, leading to **fictitious heating** of the electrons.

# 5. Differences Between Classical MD and AIMD

| **Aspect**            | **Classical MD**                                     | **AIMD (BOMD or CPMD)**                       |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **Force Evaluation**   | Empirical/semi-empirical potential (force field).   | On-the-fly quantum calculations (DFT, HF, etc.) |
| **Accuracy**           | Depends on FF parameterization                      | Systematic, can be improved with better XC functionals. |
| **Electronic Effects** | Typically ignored or approximated                  | Treated explicitly (wavefunction, electron density). |
| **Computational Cost** | Relatively low, 10⁵–10⁶ atoms for ns–µs timescales. | Very high, limited to 100s of atoms for ps–ns scales. |
| **Timescales**         | 10s–100s of ns or more feasible.                    | Typically 10s–100s of ps (rarely >1 ns).      |
| **Structural Flexibility** | Good for large biomolecules, simple materials.  | Essential for bond breaking/formation, quantum effects. |

**Key Distinction**: In classical MD, the potential energy surface (PES) is predefined by a force field. In AIMD, the PES is computed on the fly from first principles (e.g., DFT), capturing **electronic polarization**, **bond rearrangements**, and other quantum effects.

# 6. Practical Considerations

### **Choice of Electronic Structure Method**
- **DFT** is most common in AIMD due to its balance of accuracy and computational cost.
- **Post-HF methods** or hybrid functionals can be used for strongly correlated systems.

### **Plane-Wave vs. Localized Basis**
- CPMD often uses **plane-wave basis sets** with pseudopotentials.
- BOMD supports both **plane-wave** and **Gaussian-based codes** (e.g., CP2K, ORCA, Quantum ESPRESSO).

### **Timestep**
- AIMD uses smaller timesteps (e.g., 0.5–1.0 fs) compared to classical MD, especially in CPMD to ensure stable electron dynamics.

### **Temperature Control**
- **Classical thermostats** (Nosé–Hoover, Langevin) are applied to nuclei.
- CPMD uses additional thermostats or mass scaling to control fictitious electron kinetic energy.

While AIMD methods can yield very accurate simulations, each step (choice of density functional, pseudopotentials, basis sets, etc.) introduces approximations. Validation against experimental data and/or higher-level calculations (e.g., post-HF) remains a critical part of the workflow.

# 7. Conclusion

**Ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD)** enables simulations without relying on empirical force fields, making it essential for phenomena like **bond formation**, **charge transfer**, and **polarization effects**. 

- **BOMD** explicitly converges the electronic wavefunction at every step, ensuring accuracy but at high computational cost.
- **CPMD** introduces fictitious electron dynamics, avoiding repeated SCF procedures and improving efficiency, though it requires careful tuning of the fictitious electron mass ($\mu$) for accuracy.

The synergy of modern HPC resources and efficient DFT implementations expands AIMD's applicability, offering insights into chemical reactions, materials behavior, and surface phenomena—all from a quantum perspective.
