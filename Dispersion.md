# 1. The Need for Dispersion Corrections in DFT

## 1.1 Failure of Standard DFT Functionals

### Why Semilocal Functionals Neglect Dispersion

Density Functional Theory (DFT) relies on exchange-correlation (XC) functionals that approximate the many-body electronic interactions. Early and widely used functionals—such as the Local Density Approximation (LDA) and Generalized Gradient Approximations (GGAs; e.g., PBE)—are built around short-to-medium range correlation effects.

- **LDA:** Assumes that the exchange-correlation energy at a point in space depends only on the local electron density, $\rho(r)$.
- **GGA:** Improves upon LDA by including the gradient of the electron density, $\nabla \rho(r)$.

Both LDA and GGA are **semilocal**, meaning they **do not capture** the genuine **long-range electron correlation** needed to describe **van der Waals (vdW) (dispersion) interactions**. Dispersion forces arise primarily from **correlated charge fluctuations** between distant regions of a system. Because semilocal functionals only consider **density** and its **low-order derivatives** at or near a given point, they **fail to incorporate** these long-range correlation tails.

Mathematically, a key indicator is the **asymptotic form** of the exchange-correlation energy. Standard GGAs decay too rapidly with interatomic distance $R$ and **cannot produce** the $\propto 1/R^6$ or more complicated **many-body forms** typical of dispersion.

### Examples of Systems Affected

- **Weakly bound molecular systems:** Noble gas dimers (He$\cdots$He, Ar$\cdots$Ar), benzene dimers, and **DNA base pairs** all hinge on **noncovalent $\pi$-stacking** or dispersion-like interactions for their binding.
- **Layered materials:** Graphite, transition metal dichalcogenides (e.g., MoS$_2$), and **boron nitride (h-BN)** exhibit weak interlayer binding **dominated by dispersion**.
- **Adsorption phenomena:** Molecules adsorbing on metal or oxide surfaces can rely significantly on **vdW forces** to bind (e.g., CO on metal surfaces, organic molecules on oxide supports).

# 2. Dispersion Correction Methods in DFT

Over the past two decades, substantial work has been devoted to **improving DFT’s description of dispersion**. Broadly, these methods fall into three categories:

1. **Empirical dispersion corrections (DFT-D)**
2. **Nonlocal vdW functionals**
3. **Many-body dispersion (MBD) methods**

## 2.1 Empirical Dispersion Corrections (DFT-D)

**Idea:** Add a term to the DFT energy that explicitly accounts for **pairwise dispersion interactions**. Grimme pioneered widely used empirical dispersion schemes (DFT-D2, D3, D4).

### General Form

The empirical dispersion correction $E_{\text{disp}}$ typically has the form:

$$
E_{\text{disp}} = - \sum_{i<j} s_6 \, f_{\text{dmp}}(R_{ij}) \, \frac{C_{6,ij}}{R_{ij}^6},
$$

where:

- $i,j$ **index the atoms** in the system.
- $R_{ij}$ is the **distance between atoms $i$ and $j$**.
- $C_{6,ij}$ is the **effective dispersion coefficient** for the pair of atoms $(i,j)$, often **calculated from atomic polarizabilities** or **fitted parameters**.
- $s_6$ is an **overall scaling factor** tuned for different density functionals (e.g., PBE-D3, B3LYP-D3, etc.).
- $f_{\text{dmp}}(R_{ij})$ is a **damping function** ensuring that the correction **vanishes at short distances** to avoid double-counting correlation that the **underlying XC functional already covers**.

### Grimme's Methods

- **DFT-D2:** Uses a single set of $C_6$ coefficients per atom type, **parameterized from atomic properties**.
- **DFT-D3:** Introduces **coordination-number-dependent coefficients**, improving accuracy for various bonding environments.
- **DFT-D4:** Further refines the **dependence on atomic partial charges**, improving performance for charged systems and polar molecules.

#### Advantages and Limitations

**Advantages:**
- **Inexpensive** to compute (**simple pairwise summation**).
- **Straightforward** to implement in **existing DFT codes**.

**Limitations:**
- **Dependence on fitted parameters**.
- **Strictly pairwise-additive**; does not fully capture **three-body** or higher-order **nonadditive dispersion** (though partial corrections exist in **D3** and **D4**).

## 2.2 Nonlocal vdW Density Functionals

**Idea:** Incorporate **nonlocal correlation** directly into the XC functional **without relying on an external pairwise sum**. These functionals contain terms that recover a **correct long-range correlation**.

### Typical Form

A widely cited example is the **Dion et al. van der Waals functional**, known as **vdW-DF**. The total **exchange-correlation energy** $E_{\text{xc}}$ is split into **local or semilocal parts (LDA or GGA-like)** and a **nonlocal correlation part**:

$$
E_{\text{xc}} = E_x^{\text{GGA}} + E_c^{\text{LDA}} + E_c^{\text{nl}},
$$

where $E_c^{\text{nl}}$ is the **nonlocal correlation functional**:

$$
E_c^{\text{nl}}[\rho] = \frac{1}{2} \int \int dr \, dr' \, \rho(r) \, \phi(r,r') \, \rho(r'),
$$

and $\phi(r,r')$ is a **kernel** that depends on the **densities at $r$ and $r'$** and includes **nonlocal terms**.

Variants include:
- **vdW-DF** (original Dion functional).
- **vdW-DF2** (reparameterized kernel).
- **VV10** (Vydrov-Van Voorhis functional) and further variants (e.g., rVV10).

### Advantages and Limitations

**Advantages:**
- **Self-consistent approach**: **no external parameters** needed for most implementations.
- **Handles long-range correlation smoothly**.

**Limitations:**
- **Higher computational cost** than **simple pairwise corrections** due to **double spatial integration**.
- Some **overbinding or underbinding** in certain systems depending on the **kernel choices**.
