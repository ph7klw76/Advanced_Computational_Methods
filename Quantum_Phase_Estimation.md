# Quantum Phase Estimation

Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) is one of the most fundamental algorithms in quantum computing. It serves as a critical subroutine in many other quantum algorithms, such as Shor's algorithm for integer factorization and quantum algorithms for solving linear systems of equations. Understanding QPE is essential for grasping the power and potential of quantum computation.

## Introduction

In this blog post, we will delve into the mathematical foundations of QPE, providing a rigorous and detailed explanation of the algorithm. We'll explore how QPE works, the mathematical principles behind it, and its significance in the broader context of quantum computing.

### Why Quantum Phase Estimation Matters

QPE plays a pivotal role in many quantum algorithms by estimating the eigenvalues (phases) associated with unitary operators. It forms a core building block for algorithms that promise exponential speedups over classical counterparts, making it crucial for researchers and practitioners alike.

### The Problem Statement

At its core, the Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) algorithm aims to solve the following problem:

**Given:**

- A unitary operator $U$ acting on a quantum state.
- An eigenvector $\vert \psi \rangle$ of $U$, such that $U \vert \psi \rangle = e^{2 \pi i \phi} \vert \psi \rangle$, where $\phi$ is an unknown real number between 0 and 1.

**Goal:**

Estimate the phase $\phi$ with high precision.

In essence, QPE estimates the eigenvalues (phases) of a unitary operator corresponding to its eigenvectors.

## Mathematical Foundations

### Unitary Operators and Eigenvalues

A unitary operator $U$ is a linear operator that satisfies $U^{\dagger} U = UU^{\dagger} = I$, where $U^{\dagger}$ is the Hermitian adjoint of $U$, and $I$ is the identity operator. Unitary operators are significant in quantum mechanics because they represent evolution operators that preserve the norm of quantum states.

Eigenvalues of unitary operators have a special form. For a unitary $U$ and eigenvector $\vert \psi \rangle$, we have: 
$$
U \vert \psi \rangle = e^{2 \pi i \phi} \vert \psi \rangle,
$$
where $\phi$ is a real number in the range $[0, 1)$.

### Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT)

The Quantum Fourier Transform is the quantum analogue of the discrete Fourier transform. It plays a crucial role in QPE by transforming quantum states into a different basis where phase information becomes accessible.

For an $n$-qubit system, the QFT is defined as:
$$
\text{QFT} \vert k \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}} \sum_{j=0}^{2^n - 1} e^{2 \pi i kj / 2^n} \vert j \rangle.
$$
