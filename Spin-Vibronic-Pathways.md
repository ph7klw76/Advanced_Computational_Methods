# Organic TADF and OLED materials

Organic TADF and OLED materials achieve high efficiencies only when forbidden singlet–triplet interconversion becomes fast enough to recycle triplet excitons. For heavy-atom-free chromophores the purely electronic spin–orbit matrix element between the first excited singlet and triplet is typically ≤ 1 cm⁻¹, far too small to match experiment; extra vibrational physics is indispensable.

## 1. From classical Marcus to quantum MLJ

The high-frequency molecular vibrations that accompany charge or exciton transfer were incorporated into electron-transfer theory by Jortner, who showed that a Franck–Condon sum over discrete vibrons smoothly bridges thermally activated hopping at room temperature and pure tunnelling at cryogenic temperatures . The resulting MLJ rate expression

retains its form in rigid films; the only change is that the low-frequency, outer-sphere part of the reorganisation energy becomes largely static, effectively shifting the driving force rather than entering the temperature-dependent denominator. Experiments on donor-acceptor pairs embedded in frozen glycerol : methanol (9 : 1) at 255 K confirm the MLJ prediction of a Marcus inverted region even when the matrix is glassy 

## 2. Why static SOC is never enough

A first-order “Condon” calculation uses only the equilibrium SOC,

$$
\langle S_1 \lvert \hat{H}_{SO} \rvert T_1 \rangle,
$$

and therefore underestimates ISC/rISC by several orders of magnitude in purely organic molecules . Vibrational modulation of SOC (the Herzberg–Teller term) already narrows the gap, but many emitters still require an additional pathway: non-adiabatic spin-vibronic coupling.

## 3. What NA-SVC actually is

In second-order perturbation theory the spin flip is mediated by an energetically proximate triplet $T_n$:

The effective matrix element

is typically 10–100 × larger than the direct SOC because  
(i) $T_n$ often has a different orbital parentage (e.g. ππ* vs charge-transfer), and  
(ii) the derivative coupling $\langle T_n \lvert \partial/\partial Q \rvert T_1 \rangle$ is large near points where the two triplet potential-energy surfaces approach one another.

Substituting $\lvert H_{\text{NA−SVC}} \rvert^2$ into the MLJ rate integral gives a term that remains active down to at least 80 K, long after classical solvent reorganisation has frozen out; the temperature dependence now rests almost entirely in the quantum-mechanical Franck–Condon factors.

## 4. Empirical validation across temperature and media

**Zeonex and polyethylene-oxide (PEO) matrices**  
Etherington et al. measured the rISC rate of the donor–acceptor emitter DPTZ-DBTO₂ from 30 K to 300 K and showed that only a model including NA-SVC reproduces both the Arrhenius slope above 200 K and the tunnelling plateau below it

**Carbazole derivatives in crystals**  
Sidat and Crespo-Otero computed ISC and rISC for three dichloro-carbazole crystals over 100–300 K. Their MLJ+NA-SVC treatment aligns with experiment within a factor of two, whereas Marcus rates alone fail by an order of magnitude at 150 K 

**Rigid glasses showing Marcus inversion**  
Fluorescence-quenching experiments in glycerol : methanol glass reveal a clear inverted region at 255 K, quantitatively fitted only when the high-frequency FC ladder and NA-SVC are retained 

**Large data set of MR-TADF emitters**  
Hagai et al. benchmarked 121 multi-resonance TADF molecules and found that NA-SVC (with vibrationally modulated SOC included) accounts for ∼90 % of $k_{rISC}$ in the most efficient exemplars .

## 5. Implementing NA-SVC in practice

A reliable workflow now exists. TD-DFT or multi-reference methods supply vertical S₁, T₁, Tₙ energies, SOC matrix elements, and non-adiabatic derivative couplings. The vibrational spectrum is condensed to an effective high-frequency mode (ℏω ≈ 0.16 eV) plus a low-frequency reorganisation term. Packages such as **pySOC2022** and **MultiModeFC** automatically assemble the four perturbative rate components (first/second order × Condon/HT), allowing direct comparison with transient-luminescence experiments.

## 6. Consequences for molecular design

Because NA-SVC is maximised when a “mediator” triplet lies 0.1–0.3 eV above S₁, rational design now centres on tuning that triplet’s energy and orbital character. Rigidifying the π-framework funnels vibrational density into the few modes that both modulate SOC and drive $T_n \leftrightarrow T_1$ mixing, while still keeping the overall singlet–triplet gap small. The success of this strategy in MR-TADF emitters demonstrates that heavy atoms are unnecessary once NA-SVC is intelligently exploited.

## 7. Conclusion

Re-examining the spin-flip problem through the lens of NA-SVC resolves the long-standing discrepancy between bare SOC theory and the remarkably fast ISC/rISC observed in purely organic emitters. By embedding second-order, mediator-assisted spin flips in the quantum-vibrational MLJ framework, one obtains a single, parameter-consistent description that spans fluid solution, rigid glass, and crystalline films from ambient down to liquid-nitrogen temperature. As corroborated by multiple independent laboratories, this approach now sets the quantitative standard for interpreting and engineering the photophysics of next-generation OLED materials.
